# Roles of UX Deisgn

What do UX professionals do? 

Let's start off with the ***INTERFACE***.

Whenever someone's using technology they usually will interact via an interface of somekind, navbars, buttons, links, text content, and more; all of these components make up the interface, these components provide a layer of abstraction between the logic of the application and the interactions with the end user.

When we talk about UX as a whole, the interface is the primary focus. UX does not focus on the logic, programming, or even UI design, only the UX layer.

Often times there is an overlap in programming, UI, and UX design at some companies. Sometimes UX developer roles will have some programming, or UI design requirements within the job description, but UX as a field is not focused on those.

##  UX roles include

- **Research on users and context of use** which includes interviewing users, recording and observing users interacting with the app, interviewing stakeholders and owners of the application to refine the goals of the project.

- **UX Design** Meaning modeling the design UX flow, implementing details of each step through the user control flow through the app, and prototyping / storyboarding this flow to visualize the UX.

- **User testing and iteration** After interviewing, observing, and modeling the UX design, it's time for the testing phase, which will include making before and after notes and observations, and cycling and iterating through the firsy two phases when necessary.
