# UX Development

Last section we went over the typical activities of a UX professional, but now let's dissect them a bit.

It's possible for a single UX developer to be involved in all of the aspects of the UX design lifecycle, but often times these are divvied up between a team of UX developers.

Note that different companies may require certain cross-domain knowledge overlap between UX, UI, Visual Design, and Web or Software Development within a single UX developer position. 

## Common Roles 

- **UX Researcher** This role encompasses the first activity from the previous section which includes interviewing users, recording and observing users interacting with the app, interviewing stakeholders and owners of the application to refine the goals of the project, but this role often also includes research and testing conducted prior, during, and even after the UX design is finished.

- **UX Designer** This role focuses modeling the design UX flow, implementing details of each step through the user control flow through the app, and prototyping / storyboarding this flow to visualize the UX. Sometimes this role overlaps with UI design, or works very closely with the UI designer if there is one.

- **UX Strategist** This role typically refers to someone who may not directly perform UX design work, but assists in the planning, and scaffolding of UX development lifecycle workflows, assisting other UX professional team members in their daily workflow
