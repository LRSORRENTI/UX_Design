# Wireframing

Being able to wireframe a website is a critical tool in the UX developer toolbox, and practicing this skill will help create better user experience designs

It's essentially a rough visual blueprint for how the website or app will work, it doubles as a schema for the functionality of the system 

It's very useful to get a nice representation of what's happening start to finish in the app

There are different ways to wireframe, some developers start on an iPad or in Sketch, and even on pieces of paper.

***NOTE*** Wireframing is the skeleton schema /blueprint, there isn't any colors or button style selections; no styling at all, just the visual representation of the UX flow
