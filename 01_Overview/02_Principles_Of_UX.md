# Principles Of UX 

There are some key principles to keep in mind as a UX developer.

1. **Design for your target audience, and context of use**

What does this mean? 

Take a camera UX, ask yourself is the target audience a professional camera operator or is the camera tailored towards casual family photos.

The target audience will directly shape the design process, and the decisions made throughout that process.

Another example is an ios or android app, is it an app that users will be using at their desk, or is it an app they'll use while walking, or running? 

Answering these questions is pivotal to designing a great User Experience, so remember these two keys:

***TARGET AUDIENCE*** AND ***CONTEXT OF USE***

2. **Design so the product is both easy to use, and easy to learn**

This may seem obvious, most people don't set out to design a product that's difficult to use, but keeping the ***EASE OF USE*** principle in mind throughout the design process is paramount.

What does this person need to next? 
What do they want to do next?
How can we help them reach their goal within the app as easy as possible?

3. **Make the product satisfying and engaging**

This is differenc than making the product easy to use and learn, what can we do as UX designers to make the user want to use the product again?

4. **Take the goals of the organization into account**

Every app will always have a purpose beyond just UX, as a designer knowing what the organizations end goals are, and keeping them in mind throughout the design workflow is another key step that's required.

5. **The user experience is the highest priority**

Lastly, the human experience is the top priority, factoring in the principles is also necessary, but the biggest piece of the pie during the design process is this final principle.

Think of it like a pie chart where these percentages will be variable to an extent, and for some projects one given principle might have a higher or lower percentage but roughly should resemble:

### 30% **The user experience is the highest priority**

### 20% **Design so the product is both easy to use, and easy to learn**

### 20% **Make the product satisfying and engaging**

### 15% **Design for your target audience, and context of use**

### 15% **Take the goals of the organization into account**

All of these percentage may vary based on the technologies being used, the time and budget of the project, and the goals of the organization.
