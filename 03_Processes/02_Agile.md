# Agile 

Agile is a very common workflow methodology, and it's not exlusive to UX design.

Agile is a process for developing a product, especially a software product

When following Agile, the project is often divided into units or sprints, sometimes 2 - 3 weeks long, and after each of these there must be a working piece of the app or project

As a UX developer, you'll almost always be working within the development framework like Agile, or other similar workflows to expedite development
